# Game Utils

>1.1.1

## `game-utils` is a pygame engine.  The engine includes modules to facilitate boilerplate game operations. 

### Requirements

**Dependences:**
- pygame
- numpy

### Toolkit

**Manual library installation**

Run this command in your pygame project to install the game-utils package manually into your code base

>python -m game_utils.toolkit --install

This will download the whole library into your project.  Some platforms don't allow you to add Python packages, so
it might be prudent to pull this library directly into your code.  Batocera is an example, as well as other Raspberry Pi systems that come packaged without the ability to install new software.

Run this command to generate a sample Game-Utils project from the demo game

>python -m game_utils.toolkit --sample-project

**Demo Game**

Run:

>python -m game-utils.demo
